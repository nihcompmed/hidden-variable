Network Inference with Hidden Variables
=======================================

Introduction
-----------------------------
This work was motivated by the fact that real-world data often contains only subsets of variables. The hidden variables can influence the observed ones; ignoring hidden variables in network inference may lead to poor prediction results. Our ultimate goal was to develop a data-driven method that can use the configurations of observed variables to infer the interactions (observed-to-observed, hidden-to-observed, observed-to-hidden, and hidden-to-hidden), the configuration of hidden variables, and the number of hidden variables.
